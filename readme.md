# Updates

In December 2017, there was a update to the books and the code to make the service layer more consistent across books. 
If you bought the books before then, you can get the code at [this tag](https://github.com/Reboog711/LearnWith/tree/Version1).  

You can also go back to your place of purchase for to get an updated book, and you should totally do that because we caught a lot of miscellaneous errors in the text.
